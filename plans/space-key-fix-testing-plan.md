# Space Key Fix Testing Plan

## Test Cases for Space Key Completion Issue Fix

### Test Case 1: Basic Space Key Functionality
**Objective**: Verify space key works when mask regions exist
**Steps**:
1. Upload multiple images in multi-image mode
2. Select first image
3. Create mask regions by clicking on the image
4. Press space key
**Expected Result**: Image should be marked as completed and move to next image (if auto-move enabled)

### Test Case 2: Space Key with No Mask Regions
**Objective**: Verify space key provides feedback when no mask regions exist
**Steps**:
1. Upload multiple images in multi-image mode
2. Select first image
3. Do NOT create any mask regions
4. Press space key
5. Check browser console
**Expected Result**: 
- Image should NOT be marked as completed
- Console should show: "Space key: No mask regions selected - please select masking areas first"
- Space key indicator should show "(마스킹 필요)" in gray

### Test Case 3: Space Key on Already Completed Image
**Objective**: Verify space key handles already completed images correctly
**Steps**:
1. Upload multiple images in multi-image mode
2. Complete masking on first image using manual button
3. Press space key again on same image
4. Check browser console
**Expected Result**:
- No action should occur
- Console should show: "Space key: Image already completed"

### Test Case 4: Visual Feedback Validation
**Objective**: Verify visual indicators update correctly
**Steps**:
1. Upload multiple images in multi-image mode
2. Observe space key indicator before adding mask regions
3. Add mask regions
4. Observe space key indicator after adding mask regions
**Expected Result**:
- Before: Gray indicator showing "(마스킹 필요)"
- After: Green indicator showing "(가능)"

### Test Case 5: Manual vs Keyboard Consistency
**Objective**: Verify manual completion and space key use same validation
**Steps**:
1. Upload multiple images in multi-image mode
2. Try manual completion button without mask regions
3. Try space key without mask regions
4. Add mask regions
5. Try both manual completion and space key
**Expected Result**:
- Both should fail consistently when no mask regions exist
- Both should succeed consistently when mask regions exist
- Same validation messages should appear

### Test Case 6: Last Image Batch Processing
**Objective**: Verify space key triggers batch processing on last image
**Steps**:
1. Upload 3 images in multi-image mode
2. Complete first 2 images
3. Navigate to 3rd image
4. Add mask regions to 3rd image
5. Press space key
**Expected Result**: Should trigger batch processing instead of just marking complete

### Test Case 7: State Consistency Validation
**Objective**: Verify state consistency checks work in development
**Steps**:
1. Ensure NODE_ENV=development
2. Upload multiple images
3. Complete some images with masking
4. Check browser console for any state warnings
**Expected Result**: No state inconsistency warnings should appear

### Test Case 8: Rapid Key Presses
**Objective**: Verify system handles rapid space key presses gracefully
**Steps**:
1. Upload multiple images
2. Add mask regions to first image
3. Press space key multiple times rapidly
**Expected Result**: 
- Should complete only once
- No duplicate processing
- Smooth transition to next image

## Validation Checklist

### Functional Requirements
- [ ] Space key completes masking when mask regions exist
- [ ] Space key does not complete when no mask regions exist
- [ ] Space key does not re-complete already completed images
- [ ] Manual completion and space key use identical validation logic
- [ ] Last image triggers batch processing correctly

### User Experience Requirements
- [ ] Visual feedback shows space key availability status
- [ ] Console provides clear debugging information
- [ ] No disruptive alert popups during normal operation
- [ ] Keyboard shortcuts display updates dynamically

### Technical Requirements
- [ ] State consistency validation runs in development mode
- [ ] No performance degradation observed
- [ ] No memory leaks during extended sessions
- [ ] Proper event cleanup on component unmount

### Edge Cases
- [ ] Handles rapid key presses gracefully
- [ ] Works correctly with auto-move enabled/disabled
- [ ] Functions properly when switching between images
- [ ] Maintains state during image navigation

## Regression Testing

### Areas to Verify Still Work
- [ ] Manual completion buttons function correctly
- [ ] Arrow key navigation between images
- [ ] Enter key for batch processing
- [ ] Image upload and display
- [ ] Mask region creation and deletion
- [ ] Auto-move functionality
- [ ] Progress bar updates
- [ ] Tab navigation between images

## Performance Testing

### Metrics to Monitor
- [ ] Component render time remains under 100ms
- [ ] State updates complete within 50ms
- [ ] Memory usage stable during extended sessions
- [ ] No unnecessary re-renders observed

## Browser Compatibility
- [ ] Chrome (latest)
- [ ] Firefox (latest)
- [ ] Safari (latest)
- [ ] Edge (latest)
